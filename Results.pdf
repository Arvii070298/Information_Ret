Custom:
MAP is:0.6175591296515894



Part 5

The eval score we calculate is very similar to the one calculated by trec_eval, but not exactly the same.
With the default scoring algorithm, we calculate a nDCG@20 score of NDCG20 is:0.6712607859648821,
while trec_eval reports 0.7716. For our custom scoring function,
we calculate NDCG20 is:0.6645272023724066, while trec_eval calculates 0.6199.
As we are using logarithms base 2, while we implement in class determines the denominator as log2(c+1), results in log2(2)=1, results in denominator will be one larger for all calculations.
